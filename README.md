###Instructions:

1. Clean the chicken breasts under hot water to remove all the weird fatty parts.
2. Place the chicken breasts in one layer in a baking dish and bake until done.
3. While the chicken is baking, add all the other ingredients into a Crockpot and heat on high.
    1. 2x (8 ounce) packets of Philadelphia cream cheese
    2. 2x cups shredded cheese of your choice
    3. 1x cup Hidden Valley Ranch dressing
    4. 1-16oz of Texas Pete hot sauce depending on hotness level (8oz recommended)
        - 4oz = milled
        - 6oz = tangy
        - 8oz = spicy
        - 12oz = hot
        - 16oz = very hot
4. Allow the chicken breasts to cool.  Then, under warm water, rinse away all the nasty stuff that forms on the chicken when it cooks.

    - Place one breast at a time in the bowl and run mixer on it pulling it apart
